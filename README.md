# BangloreHomePrice-Prediction


This data science project series walks through step by step process of how to build a real estate price prediction Model in Banglore city. I actually first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com.During model building I try to get my hands dirty on almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc. Technology and tools wise this project covers,

1.Python
2.Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3.Matplotlib for data visualization
4.Sklearn for model building
